+ i want a force directed graph visual on the current table
- aah i have got the right match, which feature should be the \s
^ source node ?
+ city 1 
- which feature should be the target node ?
+ city 2 
- which feature should depict the strength between the nodes 
^ ?
+ distance 
// FDG trigger call 
- your requested force directed graph is now added to the \s
^ main view


// User action to open a different table 
+ i want to run clustering on this table 
- i do have a fascinating choice
